# Aggregation

This is a simple project that illustrates aggregation, an important concept in Object Oriented Programming (OOP).

Aggregation follows the has-A relationship. This creates a parent-child relationship between two classes with one class owning the object of another. In aggregation, the lifetime of the owned object does not depend on the lifetime of the owner.


In this project, a school has teams and a team has players.
